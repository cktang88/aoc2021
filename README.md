- Done in Julia b/c high perf and very expressive
  - problem is you usually have to prioritize one in a given problem lol

## Julia things

- everything is 1-indexed
- slicing is inclusive
- multidimensional arrays and matrices are different
- "missing" and "nothing" are different
- massive standard lib for numerical/linalg stuff
- lots of macros (@simd, @time, @inline, @noinline)
